# Fibonacci-Search
Fibonacci search algorithm for finding the minimum of a function.
This program performs the Fibonacci Line Search algorithm to find the minimum of a unimodal function f(x) over an interval [a,b].
This method improves on Ternary Search and Dichotomous Search be reusing interval points based on ratios from the Fibonacci Sequence.
Fibonacci search algorithm has the least number of function calls compared to Ternary Search and Dichotomous Search.
It was discovered by J. Kiefer and S. M. Johnson.
