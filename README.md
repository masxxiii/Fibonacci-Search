# Fibonacci-Search
Fibonacci search algorithm for finding the minimum of a function.

This program performs the Fibonacci Line Search algorithm to find the minimum of a unimodal function f(x) over an interval [a,b].
This method improves on Ternary Search and Dichotomous Search be reusing interval points based on ratios from the Fibonacci Sequence.
The Fibonacci method differs from the golden ratio method in that the ratio for the reduction of intervals is not constant. Additionally, the number of iterations is predetermined and based on the specified tolerance.
The Fibonacci search method has the least number of function calls compared to Ternary Search and Dichotomous Search.
It was discovered by J. Kiefer and S. M. Johnson.
